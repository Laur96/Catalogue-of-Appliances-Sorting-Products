# Catalogue-of-Appliances-Sorting-Products

In this Python project, the goal was to create a software solution for organizing and sorting small and large appliances based on price, consumption, manufacturer, and product code. The project showcases a comprehensive understanding of object-oriented programming, functional programming, and procedural programming in Python. The software allows for both direct entry of appliance objects with specific parameters (price, consumption, producer, product code) within the code itself, as well as indirect input from the user via keyboard input. The sorting functionality of the software is designed to arrange products based on their price and consumption attributes. Key features of the project include:

    Object-Oriented Programming: The project demonstrates a clear understanding of object-oriented concepts, with classes representing different types of appliances and inheritance relationships to capture specific attributes.
    Functional Programming: The use of lambda functions for sorting showcases an understanding of functional programming concepts within Python.
    Procedural Programming: The project incorporates procedural programming techniques to handle the logic and flow of the software.
    User-Friendly Design: The software is designed to be easily understandable for Python programmers, with explicit naming and clear presentation of object-oriented concepts for quick comprehension.
    Efficient Sorting: The sorting functionality allows for efficient organization of appliances based on price and consumption, enhancing the usability and effectiveness of the software.

Overall, this project serves as a comprehensive example of applying various programming paradigms in Python to create a functional and well-structured software solution for managing and sorting appliances in a catalogue.
