# Catalogue-of-Appliances-Sorting-Products

In this project I set out to develop a software that arranges and sorts small or
large appliances, depending on the price, consumption, name of the
manufacturer and the bar code of the product.
I have covered almost everything that is known about object oriented
programming as well as functional programming in the Python language,
where I introduced the lambda concept or keyword, obviously followed by the
well known classical procedural programming.
The functionality of the software consists in the direct entry in the code of the
object characterized by the four parameters(price consumption, producer,
product code), as well as the indirect introduction of the object(i.e. from the
keyboard), also characterized by the same four parameters where the
software sorts depending on the price and consumption of each product.
All concepts and names related to object oriented programming are presented
in an explicit way so that any Python programmer or developer can
understand the whole code in less that two or three minutes, and also how to
run the code without the need of explanation of each line of code.
